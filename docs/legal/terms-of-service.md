## **1. Acceptance of Terms**
By accessing or using the Dropsome interface at https://dropsome.xyz (the "Interface"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the Interface. We may update these Terms at any time, and continued use of the Interface constitutes acceptance of any changes. The latest version will be available at https://dropsome.xyz.

## **2. Description of Service**
Dropsome is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application built on the Solana blockchain, designed to facilitate the sharing of small amounts of SOL with individuals who do not yet have a wallet. The Interface enables the following features:
* **Drop**: Users ("Depositors") can send SOL to a Program-Derived Address (PDA) account, which creates a new encrypted wallet for the recipient. The wallet data is encrypted and shared via a link. When the link is opened, the recipient receives clear instructions to set up and initialize the wallet.
* **Claim**: Upon opening the link and initializing the wallet, a transaction transfers the deposited SOL from the PDA to the recipient's new wallet.
* **Refund**: Depositors can reclaim unclaimed deposits if the recipient does not claim the SOL.

The application (Interface) consists of an on-chain Solana program and a web interface.  

## **3. User Eligibility and Access**
The Interface is accessible to all users globally without any Know Your Customer (KYC), location, or account requirements. Users are required to connect their Solana wallets directly to utilize the Interface. Users bear full responsibility for ensuring that their use of the Interface complies with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction. Additionally, users must be of legal age to engage in financial transactions in their jurisdiction to use the Interface.

## **4. User Responsibilities**
You are solely responsible for your decision to use the Interface, including understanding the risks associated with blockchain technology, SOL volatility, and potential smart contract vulnerabilities.  
You must secure your wallet credentials, private keys, and any links shared via the Interface. Dropsome is not liable for any loss of funds, unauthorized access, or misuse resulting from your failure to protect your assets.  
Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to, illegal use, hacking, money laundering, or any attempt to disrupt the Interface or Solana network.

## **5. Intellectual Property**
* All trademarks, logos, branding, and other intellectual property related to Dropsome are the exclusive property of the Dropsome team.
* The Solana program and user interface code are open-source and licensed under the **Apache 2.0 license**. Users may access, use, modify, and distribute the code subject to the terms of the Apache 2.0 license, available at https://github.com/dropsome-xyz.

## **6. Fees and Payments**
A small service fee will be charged to Depositors for each "drop" transaction. This fee is non-refundable unless explicitly stated otherwise. The exact fee amount will be clearly disclosed in the Interface prior to initiating any transaction.

## **7. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability**
* The Interface is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
* Dropsome does not guarantee the security, functionality, or availability of the Interface, the Solana blockchain, or any third-party services. You acknowledge that blockchain technology and cryptocurrency carry inherent risks, including but not limited to smart contract bugs, network failures, and price volatility.
* To the maximum extent permitted by law, Dropsome shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Interface.
* You agree that your use of the Interface is at your own risk, and Dropsome is not responsible for any illegal or unauthorized use by third parties.

## **8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with general principles of international commercial law.
Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) under its Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be a neutral location to be agreed upon by the parties, or if no agreement is reached, determined by the ICC. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The prevailing party in any arbitration shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.

## **9. Miscellaneous**
* **Severability**: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
* **Entire Agreement**: These Terms, together with the Dropsome Privacy Policy (available at https://dropsome.xyz), constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropsome regarding your use of the Interface.
